# Twitch status checker

Made this program as a learning project for [Freecodecamp](https://freecodecamp.com). It's supposed to check which streamers from the list are currently online and if someone is currently streaming show the title of their stream. Will try to rebuild this project as well as my wikipedia viewer using Angular/React/Vue, depending which one I learn first.
